# Currently Incomplete

## Setup

1. **Configuration**

Copy `src/config.template.json` to `src/config.json` and fill in the data.

If you do not have a `cdclient.sqlite` create one from your `cdclient.fdb` at https://fdb.lu-dev.net/.

2. Idk how someone is supposed to set up a TypeScript Project (if they transpile the files or i do or what), so good luck, I'll figure this out when it's in a usable state :)
