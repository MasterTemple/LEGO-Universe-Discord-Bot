# Currently Incomplete

## Setup
1. **Configuration**

Copy `src/config.template.json` to `src/config.json` and fill in the data.

If you do not have a `cdclient.sqlite` check out [lcdr's utils](https://github.com/lcdr/utils) and use `./utils/fdb_to_sqlite.py` to convert the `cdclient.fdb` to `cdclient.sqlite`.

2. Idk how someone is supposed to set up a TypeScript Project (if they transpile the files or i do or what), so good luck, I'll figure this out when it's in a usable state :)
